		<p>Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO.
		   In the mythical continent of Westeros, several powerful families fight for control of the Seven Kingdoms.
		   As conflict erupts in the kingdoms of men, an ancient enemy rises once again to threaten them all. Meanwhile, 
		   the last heirs of a recently usurped dynasty plot to take back their homeland from across the Narrow Sea.
		   Years after a rebellion spurred by a stolen bride to be and the blind ambitions of a mad King, Robert of the house 
		   Baratheon (Mark Addy) sits on the much desired Iron Throne. In the mythical land of Westeros, nine noble families 
		   fight for every inch of control and every drop of power. The King's Hand, Jon Arryn (Sir John Standing), is dead. 
		   And Robert seeks out his only other ally in all of Westeros, his childhood friend Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark.
		   The solemn and honorable Warden of the North is tasked to depart his frozen sanctuary and join the King in the 
		   capital of King's Landing to help the now overweight and drunk Robert rule. However, a letter in the dead of night 
		   informs "Ned" that the former Hand was murdered, and that Robert will be next. So noble Ned goes against his better 
		   desires in an attempt to save his friend and the kingdoms. But political intrigue, plots, murders, and sexual desires 
		   lead to a secret that could tear the Seven Kingdoms apart. And soon Eddard will find out what happens when you play the 
		   Game of Thrones.
